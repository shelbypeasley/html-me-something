                    <p>What if god was one of us? Just a slob like one of us? More importantly, what if this slob here (me) were suddenly bestowed the power equivelent to a god for one day only? This is what I would do.</p><br>

                    <br><p>If I were given powers of a god (just any god really, not a specific one) meaning I was able to alter reality with no
                            limitations whatsoever, the first thing I would do is something that is on all of our minds... I would make it so we could
                            have a do over election and choose a different president. It doesn't even have to be that good of a president, just a 
                            different one that doesn't work for the devil himself. In fact, he would be banished to live the rest of his life on 
                            an island with all of the people he has offended in his short, shitty presidency. That includes, hispanics, african americans,
                            well basically any race other than white people, LGBTQA individuals, disabled people, the list goes on. They would be happy
                            and live abundantly while he was forced to watch their happiness from a tiny shack up on the point of a tall mountain that
                            he has to climb up and down everyday to get food and water. Since I have my powers for a day, I wouldn't want to change so much
                            about the world and regret it the next day! This is the perfect start.</p>

                    <br><p>My second order of business would be to replinish that pesky ozone layer that we've ripped and shredded like a candy 
                            wrapper that doesn't mean anything. At the same time, I'd great rid of all of the coal and oil and cars and 
                            some of the people (hey, overpopulation is a major threat), the current meat
                            distribution system and industry, the fishing industry of course, as well as all replace all of the plastic with something
                            better that I would be able to come up with because I'm a god, duh! I'm sure we would just end up depleting and ruining the new ozone too, but this gives
                            us a head start so we can have more time to colonize other planets and ruin their environments as well. </p><br>

                    <br><p>The third thing that I would change would be the unequal distribution of wealth. No one needs that much money, just
                            enough to live comfortably without having to worry if your children are going to starve to death. The wealth gap is real,
                            the rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer! Redistribution would help solve many problems such as:
                            obesity as well as starvation, mental health issues, addiction, homicides, imprisonment rates, and more.
                            Not to mention, it would probably help stop war, because what else do we fight wars for other than money?? Of course I would
                            do all of these things without the public's knowledge. It would be like a branch off of our current timeline and nobody
                            would remember what happened.</p><br>

                    <br><p>Okay, but let's talk about another major problem in the world: racism. Get that out of here! That would be my fourth act,
                            to iradicate the world of the gaping puss-filled sore that is systematic racism. No one should be discriminated against for something
                            as superficial as the color of their skin. They should be discriminated against for sucking as a person and that's it! I
                            would just wipe that shit from people's minds, but I wouldn't let them forget it so that this sort of thing never happens
                            again. Now that everyone has a fairly equal distribution of wealth after my last act, it will now be possible for people
                            of all races to have an opportunity at a fair life and actually pursue happiness! Hell, let's get rid of sexism too while
                            we're at it. Really, just all of the terrible isms. Get em out of here!</p><br>

                    <br><p>Let's keep going. I've been pretty serious so far. That is the humanitarian in me. But let's be honest, there is something
                            that we all wish would be true. For my fifth action as god, I would make it so that all of the delicious foods in life, 
                            donuts, french fries, pizza, macaroni and cheese, brownies, ice cream, etc. would no longer be detrimental to our health.
                            Instead, they would simply be eaten for enjoyment. They wouldn't necessarily be healthy for us, just not bad for us. Then
                            we could eat without guilt. I think this would contribute to the morale of humans as a whole, not to mention it would help
                            rid the world of obesity and also lower the homicide rate because we would all be so happy.</p><br>

                    <br><p>There is only so much time left in my day as a god, what else could I do? I've rid the world of an ulcer, helped the
                            environment, helped the poor which helps everybody else, ended racism, and I've made delicious foods guilt free. That's pretty much
                            all of our problems. More or less, gods aren't really perfect, we can't do it all!</p><br>
